# Auto_price_regression
It is a linear regression model to predict the price of different automobiles.

The notebook consists of the following 3 main steps for building the model to predict the price of different automobiles:-

i) Data Visualization to get an understanding of the relationship present in the data. It helps in identifying the features that are useful for predicting the label (i.e the price in this case) and the also the features that are redundant and do not carry any information for prediction.

ii) Data cleaning and transformation to address the problems associated with the data. Features are transformed to come up with features that are more predictive of the label.

iii) Construction and evaluation of the machine learning model. The model is trained using a linear regression model and the different regression loss metrics are used to determine the performance of the regression model.
